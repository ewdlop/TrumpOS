In **Slay the Spire**, the concept of a merchant hero or merchant-specific hero card deck isn't directly part of the game. However, players sometimes imagine what it might be like to play as the **Merchant**, a character who facilitates card and relic purchases, as a hero with unique abilities. Here's a speculative take on what a **Merchant Hero** might look like, along with ideas for hero card decks:

---

### **Merchant Hero Overview**
- **Starting Relic:** **Gold Hoard**  
  Gain extra gold at the end of combat (+20%). Shops always have one additional card and relic option.
- **Starting HP:** 70 (lower to balance strong gold and shop-based powers).
- **Unique Mechanic:** **Barter System**  
  Cards and abilities revolve around gold management, shop synergies, and resourceful gameplay. Spend gold for powerful effects but risk running out of resources for future purchases.

### **Card Deck Archetypes**
1. **Gold Manipulation Deck**  
   Focus on gaining, hoarding, and strategically spending gold for effects.
   - **Payday (Attack):** Spend 50 gold. Deal 20 damage to all enemies.
   - **Investment (Skill):** Spend X gold. At the start of your next turn, gain X*2 gold.
   - **Greedy Swipe (Attack):** Deal 8 damage. Gain 10 gold if the target is defeated.
   - **Golden Shield (Skill):** Spend 30 gold. Gain 15 Block.

2. **Discount/Shop Synergy Deck**  
   Exploit cheaper card costs and bonuses related to shopping.
   - **Shopkeeper's Trick (Skill):** Reduce the cost of the next card you play this turn by 1 (min 0).
   - **Bulk Buy (Power):** The first card you buy each shop costs 50% less gold.
   - **Sales Frenzy (Attack):** Spend 10 gold. Deal 10 damage and apply Weak.
   - **Market Frenzy (Skill):** Double your gold but add 2 Dazed to your draw pile.

3. **Relic Synergy Deck**  
   Amplify the effects of existing relics or generate new relics mid-run.
   - **Collector's Pride (Power):** For every 2 relics you own, gain +1 Strength.
   - **Mystic Trinket (Skill):** Spend 100 gold. Gain a random relic.
   - **Hoarderâ€™s Curse (Skill):** Lose a relic. Gain 30 Block and 3 Energy.
   - **Rare Artifact (Power):** At the start of each turn, gain 5 gold.

4. **Debuff and Control Deck**  
   Control enemies with economic-themed debuffs.
   - **Taxation (Skill):** Apply Frail and Weak. Gain 15 gold.
   - **Bribe (Skill):** Spend 30 gold. Remove all enemy block.
   - **Economic Collapse (Power):** All enemies lose 2 Strength for every 100 gold you have.

### **Playstyle**
- **Pros:**
  - Flexible economy-based mechanics allow for explosive moments.
  - Synergy between gold, relics, and strategic spending opens unique builds.
  - Strong early-mid game due to gold-boosting mechanics and access to shops.
- **Cons:**
  - Reliant on shop locations and gold for powerful effects.
  - Poor synergy with "free" cards and limited draw potential.
  - Late game can struggle without proper investments or relics.

### Merchant Hero Lore
A mysterious entrepreneur who grew tired of staying on the sidelines, the **Merchant** finally enters the Spire not just to sell wares, but to dominate the competition. Wielding the power of wealth and commerce, the Merchant turns gold into might and cunning into survival.
